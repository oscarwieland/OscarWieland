## Projects
Here are some projects I've been working on:

- ### R projects

- [Casino Shiny app](https://github.com/SimoesBarbosaRicardo/Roulette-Lab)
- [Lafayette Case](https://github.com/oscarwieland/Lafayette-Case)


In this comprehensive project, I undertook an in-depth analysis to uncover the key drivers of brand equity for Galeries Lafayette. The goal was to understand how customers perceive the brand and how these perceptions influence their loyalty and commitment.

Starting with the provided dataset of 553 customer responses, I first reorganized the data and conducted a thorough analysis of missing values. To explore the underlying dimensions of customer perception, I performed both Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). This process involved applying tests like the Bartlett test, KMO measure, and Anti-Image matrix, as well as using the Scree-test and Kaiser criterion to determine the appropriate number of factors. I then carried out Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to further refine the model.

Following this, I evaluated both local and global fit to ensure the robustness of the measurement model. Finally, I conducted path analysis to explore the relationships between these factors and key outcomes such as customer loyalty and commitment. The findings provided valuable insights, leading to actionable recommendations for Galeries Lafayette to enhance their brand equity and strengthen customer relationships.

***Skills used***: Exploratory factor analysis, Confirmatory factor analysis, SEM

- [Quality Evaluation Case](https://github.com/oscarwieland/Quality-Evaluation-case)

This project presents a detailed case study on factor analysis. The goal of this analysis is to uncover patterns that are not immediately visible, allowing for a deeper understanding of the data's structure.

In this case study, we apply factor analysis to a dataset to reveal the hidden dimensions that influence observed variables. The project walks through the process of determining the number of factors that best represent the data, extracting these factors, and interpreting the results in a meaningful way.

The study also compares different methods of factor extraction and rotation, evaluating their effectiveness in simplifying and clarifying the relationships between variables. Additionally, it explores the impact of allowing correlations between factors, which is often crucial when dealing with complex, real-world data.

***Skills used***:Exploratory factor analysis, Confirmatory factor analysis, SEM, Factor Rotation Techniques (Varimax, Promax), Principal Component Analysis (PCA

- [Heliotronics Case](https://github.com/oscarwieland/Heliotronics-Case)

This project focuses on a detailed analysis and strategic decision-making process for Heliotronics, a company navigating complex business challenges. The case study involves an in-depth examination of various business scenarios, leveraging data analysis, financial modeling, and strategic management principles to evaluate potential outcomes and recommend the best course of action. By applying techniques such as regression analysis and scenario modeling, the project aims to forecast the financial and operational impacts of different strategic options. 

- ### Python projects
- [Stackoverflow predictions](https://github.com/oscarwieland/Machine-Learning-project)

The objective of this project is to develop an accurate machine learning model to automate the tagging of user-generated posts on Stack Overflow. These tags improve the platform's usability by helping users filter and find content relevant to their expertise. To achieve this, we began with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the patterns in the dataset, which includes posts and their corresponding tags. We then tested multiple machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, selecting the best based on training time, testing time, and accuracy. Feature engineering was performed to process the text, employing techniques like tokenization, vectorization, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform raw text into a machine-readable format. Finally, we evaluated our models using accuracy as the key metric, measuring the proportion of correctly predicted tags for each post.

***Skills used***: Natural Lenguage Processing (NLP), Machine learning models (Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

### Power BI projects
- [Survey analysis](https://github.com/oscarwieland/survey-analysis)

In this little project, i had the opportunity to edit an excel table directly with power BI. Subsequently, I created graphical representations in Power BI to better understand this Data professional survey and be able to draw conclusions.

- [Cars Sales analysis](https://github.com/oscarwieland/Cars_sales)

The objective of this project is to meticulously monitor and analyze the sales performance of a car sales company. To achieve this goal, I have developed a dynamic and interactive dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard incorporates key performance indicators (KPIs) derived from sales data, including Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales, Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales, YTD Average Price, YTD Cars Sold, and various others.

These insights will empower stakeholders to make informed decisions, closely track progress, and pinpoint emerging trends and opportunities for growth.
